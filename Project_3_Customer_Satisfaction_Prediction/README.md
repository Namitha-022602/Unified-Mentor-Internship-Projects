# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance

**Objective:** Analyze employee attrition trends and build a predictive model to identify high-risk employees.

## Project Overview
This project explores HR analytics data to uncover key drivers of attrition using:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- SQL-based insights
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Explainability (SHAP, Permutation Importance)
- Business Recommendations

## Dataset
Source: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset (`WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`)

## Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP, SQLite

## Key Results
- Top predictors of attrition: **MonthlyIncome**, **OverTime**, **WorkLifeBalance**, **Tenure**
- Early-career employees (<3 years) show higher churn
- SHAP-based explainability added for HR interpretability

## Final Deliverables
