## 📊 Project Overview
This Tableau dashboard analyzes the Supply Chain performance of a Fashion & Beauty startup.

It visualizes **Inventory Management**, **Supplier Performance**, **Transportation Efficiency**, and **Cost Analysis** to optimize overall profitability and operational efficiency.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Tableau Desktop
- Excel / CSV Dataset
- SQL (Data Cleaning)
  
## 🧾 Key KPIs
- Total Revenue: ₹577,605  
- Total Inventory Value: ₹243,857  
- On-Time Delivery Rate: 86%  
- Profit Margin: 28.4%  
- Avg Lead Time: 3.1 days  
- Avg Defect Rate: 1.9%
  
## 💡 Key Insights
- Skincare has the **highest profit margin (22%)** but also the **highest defect rate (4.8%)**, mainly from *Supplier 2*.
- *Supplier 4* performs best — **lowest defect rate (1.2%)** and **shortest lead time**.
- **Makeup Brushes** are overstocked (Stock-to-Sales Ratio = 5.2).
- **Air transport** is fastest but costliest; *Rail* reduces costs by ~40%.

## ✅ Recommendations
1. Shift skincare sourcing from Supplier 2 → Supplier 4 to improve product quality.
2. Rebalance inventory for low-turnover products (Makeup Brushes).
3. Optimize transportation mix — use Rail for non-urgent deliveries.
4. Monitor supplier scorecard monthly to maintain efficiency.
